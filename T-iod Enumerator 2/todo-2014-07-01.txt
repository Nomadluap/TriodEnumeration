change completion generator to create only surjective maps. 
- assign points that become endpoints(triple)
- define map coming away from those points
- disregard any 'impossible' mapping that forces itself to become continouos

- when you arrive at the point that should become the endpoint,




a1, a2, a3 distinguished

f(u) ius assigned, v is ajacent to u

dist(v, a1) >= dist(f(v), tip1)
