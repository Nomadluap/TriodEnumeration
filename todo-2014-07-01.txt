change completion generator to create only surjective maps. 
- assign points that become endpoints(triple)
- define map coming away from those points
- disregard any 'impossible' mapping that forces itself to become continouos

- when you arrive at the point that should become the endpoint,




a1, a2, a3 distinguished

f(u) ius assigned, v is ajacent to u

dist(v, a1) >= dist(f(v), tip1)

        1. Find the first leg which is incomplete.
        2. check the endpoint list to determine if any endpoints are to be
        mapped to the undefined portion of that leg.
            a. if not, add an ajacent point and then recusively continue.
            b. if yes, then take the distance between the most recent domain
            point and the one listed in the endpoint map (X), and compare it to
            the distance between that endpoint coordinate and the most recent
            codomain point. (Y)
                i. if X < Y then there is no way for the mapping to connect in
                the way specified. Return without yielding
                ii. If X == Y then connect the points directly and recursively
                continue.
                iii. If X > Y  then we have room to wiggle. Make the next
                codomain point a point connected to the current one, and then
                recursively continue.
